You can take advantage of this promo by using our Quotex promo code when
making deposits to your trading account.

These promo codes expire on August 16, 2025, and are limited to only 300
clients. This means that there is a huge competition for these codes,
and the faster you use them, the more chances you have of activating the
bonus code.

## What is a Bonus Code or Promo Code in Quotex?

A bonus code, also known as a promo code in Quotex is a special word,
character, or a mix of letters, numbers, and characters that you can use
in the promo area in a Quotex deposit process to get extra money for
FREE.

If you have access to any promo code, you must use them to: --

1.  Increase your trading capital
2.  Get free extra cash for trading money

Plus, Quotex promo codes and bonuses are not limited to a maximum of 50%
extra cash; you can sometimes get bonuses as high as 100%.

### Other bonuses to take advantage of in Quotex

1.  **Risk-free trades:** this is a special kind of bonus offered to
    active traders to use in their daily trading. As the name suggests,
    Quotex risk-free trades are trades that remove all the risks from
    trading.
2.  **Cashback:** This kind of bonus is more or less the same as the
    risk-free trades bonus but with a twist. Unlike risk-free trades
    that give you back all your lost money, cashback allows you to only
    receive a percentage of your trading volume back.
3.  **Cancel X points:** This is a tool used on Quotex to cancel a
    losing trade. If you use this tool you will salvage your money if
    your trade is losing.
4.  **Percentage of turnover:** This promo bonus allows you to get a
    percentage of your trading volume back when you trade.
